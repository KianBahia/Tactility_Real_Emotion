# 🎯 Objective of the Project

This project aims to develop a **text-to-speech (TTS) application capable of expressing emotions**.  
We integrated the **[Hume AI](https://dev.hume.ai)** API to enable real-time emotional speech generation.

## ✨ Features

- **Shortcut sentences** for quick playback.  
- **Emotion-based TTS**, where emojis at the top define the emotional tone of the spoken sentence.  
- **Sentence history** to easily replay previously used phrases.  
- **Settings** section with:
  - Voice selection and the ability to add **custom voices**.  
  - “**Speak as you type**” mode.  
  - **Highlighting** of the spoken text.  
  - Adjustable **delay** before speech starts.

Here are the list of the emoji and the corresponding emotion:

- 🤩 Enthousiasm for a job (formal)
- 🤣 Funny/sarcastic
- 🥳 Happy
- 😡 Angry 
- 😢 Sadly/ depression 
- 🙂 Neutral
- 🫠 Anxious 
- 🤢 Awful 
- 🫣 Shy
- 😑 Dont care 
- 🥺 Admire
